A startup wants to keep costs low by paying only when resources are actually running without long-term contracts. Which cloud characteristic supports this?,multiple-choice,Capital expenditure (CapEx),"Refers to upfront hardware costs, which is the opposite of the cloud consumption model.",Fixed monthly billing,Contradicts consumption-based pricing which varies by actual usage.,Pay only for the resources you consume,The consumption-based (pay-as-you-go) model eliminates wasted capacity and upfront hardware costs.,Mandatory multi-year commitments,"This applies to Reserved Instances, not flexible consumption models.",,,,,3,Key Takeaway: Consumption-based pricing lets you pay only for the cloud resources you actually use.,Azure Management and Governance
"Scalability in cloud computing refers to the ability to automatically adjust compute, storage, or networking resources as workload demand changes.",multiple-choice,TRUE,Scalability allows resources to grow or shrink automatically or manually to match demand and avoid overprovisioning.,FALSE,This statement accurately describes the core cloud benefit of scalability.,,,,,,,,,1,Key Takeaway: Scalability allows cloud environments to increase or decrease resources automatically based on workload needs.,Cloud Concepts
A financial institution needs a web app environment where compute and network resources are dedicated solely to them for maximum isolation. Which option should they choose?,multiple-choice,App Service Environment (ASE),ASE provides fully isolated and dedicated compute/network resources not shared with other customers.,Standard App Service Plan,Runs on shared (multi-tenant) infrastructure.,Azure Virtual Machines,Provides isolation but requires manual management of the OS and runtime.,Shared App Service Plan,Runs on shared compute; not suitable for high-security compliance needs.,,,,,1,"Key Takeaway: App Service Environment (ASE) is the only hosting option that provides fully isolated, dedicated hardware and networking.",Azure Architecture and Services
What is the minimum number of Availability Zones you should deploy an application across to achieve zone-level high availability?,multiple-choice,1,A single zone provides no redundancy against datacenter failure.,2,"To achieve zone-level redundancy, you must run in at least two zones so the app remains available if one zone fails.",4,Most Azure regions only offer up to 3 Availability Zones.,5,Not a standard Azure configuration; 2 is the minimum requirement for zone-level HA.,,,,,2,"Key Takeaway: To achieve high availability across datacenter failures, you must deploy in at least two Azure Availability Zones.",Azure Architecture and Services
"In Azure, a _________ is a set of datacenters deployed within a specific geographic boundary and interconnected through low-latency networks.",multiple-choice,Geography,A geography contains multiple regions; it is used for data residency compliance.,Region,"An Azure region is the fundamental unit where resources reside, consisting of one or more connected datacenters.",Availability Zone,"A physically separate datacenter within a region, not the region itself.",Edge location,"Used for caching content (CDN), not for deploying primary compute workloads.",,,,,2,Key Takeaway: An Azure region is the geographic unit consisting of one or more low-latency connected datacenters.,Cloud Concepts
Which of the following is a key advantage of using Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) for secure remote access?,multiple-choice,Eliminates user identity management,Identities must still be managed via Microsoft Entra ID.,Run desktops on on-prem hardware,AVD is a cloud-hosted service; it replaces on-prem VDI hardware.,Cloud-based virtualization with improved scalability,AVD reduces infrastructure overhead and allows you to scale desktops based on demand while Microsoft handles the hardware.,Removes need for security config,"You still must configure access policies, MFA, and networking.",,,,,3,Key Takeaway: Azure Virtual Desktop simplifies VDI by providing cloud-based scalability and reduced management overhead.,Azure Architecture and Services
"Which Azure feature should be used to logically organize related resources so they can be managed, monitored, and deleted together?",multiple-choice,Azure Management Groups,"Used to organize subscriptions, not individual resources.",Azure Subscriptions,Provide billing boundaries rather than lifecycle grouping for related apps.,Azure Resource Groups,Resource Groups are logical containers that allow you to manage and apply RBAC to related resources as a single unit.,Azure Blueprints,"Used for governing environment templates, not for post-deployment grouping.",,,,,3,Key Takeaway: Resource Groups let you organize and manage related Azure resources as a single unit throughout their lifecycle.,Azure Management and Governance
Azure __________ enables you to connect two virtual networks together so resources can communicate as if they were on the same network.,multiple-choice,VPN Gateway,Used for hybrid or site-to-site connectivity; more complex than peering for internal VNet connections.,VNet Peering,"VNet Peering provides direct, low-latency communication between networks over the Azure backbone.",Application Gateway,"A Layer 7 load balancer, not a network connectivity tool.",Load Balancer,Distributes traffic to VMs but does not connect separate networks.,,,,,2,Key Takeaway: VNet Peering is the built-in mechanism to connect virtual networks seamlessly over the Azure backbone.,Azure Architecture and Services
