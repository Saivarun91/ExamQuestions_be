Your organization uses several cloud-based business applications. Employees currently have to enter their username and password separately for each application. The IT department wants to streamline access so users authenticate once and then seamlessly access all approved apps. Which Azure service provides this capability?,multiple-choice,Microsoft Entra ID Single Sign-On (SSO),Microsoft Entra ID Single Sign-On (SSO) is the specific capability within Microsoft Entra ID that enables this seamless access across multiple applications after a single initial authentication.,Azure Monitor,"This service is used for collecting, analyzing, and acting on telemetry data from your cloud and on-premises environments.

Which Microsoft Entra ID feature enables this capability?,multiple-choice,Conditional Access,"Conditional Access can require MFA based on policies, but it is not the feature that provides the additional verification factor itself. MFA is the mechanism; Conditional Access is the policy engine.",Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA),Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds a second verification step to the sign-in process. It commonly uses: · Microsoft Authenticator app notifications · SMS verification codes · Voice calls · Hardware tokens. This drastically reduces account compromise risks by requiring something you know (password) + something you have (phone/app).,Privileged Identity Management (PIM),"PIM manages just-in-time privileged access, not user sign-in verification. It may use MFA, but it does not provide MFA.",Identity Protection,"Identity Protection detects risky sign-ins and users.
