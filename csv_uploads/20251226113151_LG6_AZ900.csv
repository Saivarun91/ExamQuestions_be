"An application running in Azure needs to handle a rapidly growing number of users. Instead of increasing the size of a single server, the design allows adding more identical servers behind a load balancer as demand grows. Which type of scaling does this approach represent?",multiple-choice,Vertical scaling (scaling up),"Vertical scaling (scaling up) means increasing the size of an existing resource (more CPU/RAM). It is limited by the maximum size of a single machine and often requires downtime.
